Customized NBA Player Search Engine 

UIUC CS 411 Final Project


This website utlizes MySQL and MongoDB databases alongside a PHP backend to allow for search of NBA players to identify playstyles of each player. Additional functionality includes analysis of a 5 man roster to determine overall offensive/defensive skill and team playstyle. Basic functionality includes adding, removing, or updating player statistics. More information can be found in the project report page(https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/x/lBW0Kw).
