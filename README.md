Customized NBA Player Search Engine 

UIUC CS 411 Fall 2020 Final Project


This website utilizes MySQL and MongoDB databases alongside a PHP backend to allow for search of NBA players to identify playstyles of each player. Basic functionality includes adding, removing, or updating player statistics. Additional functionality includes analysis of a 5 man roster to determine overall offensive/defensive skill and team playstyle. More information can be found in the project report documents above and demo video below!
